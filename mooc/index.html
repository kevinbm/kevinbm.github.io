	<h3>List of Massive Open Online Courses</h3>
	<p>These are the online courses I've taken so far. My idea with this section is to show my current interests and what part of my background I am strengthening. The table is fairly self-explanatory. Just to make a point, the <i>Honor</i> column contains links to Statements of Accomplishment, Honor Code Certificates, Verified Certificates, and so on. <i>None</i> means that I couldn't take the course while it was running and just completed the assignments.</p>
