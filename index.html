			<h4 style="margin-top:10px;">Welcome to my personal page!</h4>

			<p>I am <strong>Kevin Bello</strong>, a prospective graduate student interested in doing research in Machine Learning and its diverse range of applications. I received a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Engineering">National University of Engineering</a> (UNI, Peru) in 2014. There I have been doing research in Machine Learning and Natural Langauge Processing advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado">Alberto Coronado</a>.</p>

			<p>Currently, I am the president of the Artificial Intelligence and Control Systems Research Laboratory (<a href="http://giscia.github.io/" target="_blank">GISCIA</a>) at UNI. The lab is leaded by UNI students who are interested in following a research career. We have published several papers, being recognized as one of the best student labs at UNI. In addition, we try to motivate undergraduate students to get involved in research. The main research topics at GISCIA are related to Robotics, Machine Learning for Natural Language, Computer Vision and Finance but we are always excited to do other kinds of multidisciplinary work. To know more about the lab, take a look at the lab's <a href="http://giscia.github.io/" target="_blank">webpage</a>.</p>
			<p>I like to participate in programming competitions from time to time. Here is my topcoder profile: <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/members/kevinbm/" target="_blank">kevinbm</a>. </p>

                  <strong>06/2015:</strong> I will be attending the Machine Learning Summer School (<a href="http://www.iip.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mlss15/doku.php?id=speaker" target="_blank">MLSS'15</a>) in August. Many advanced topics will be covered, this will help me to get a better grasp of the state-of-the-art ML. Also, I am going to present a poster about an application of topic models to education. Can't wait to meet outstanding people there!
