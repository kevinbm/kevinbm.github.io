<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my personal page.

I am a fifth-year student major in Mechatronics Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria in Lima, Peru.

I am the president of the Artificial Intelligence and Control Systems Research Group (GISCIA) at my university. There, my colleagues and I guide and lead new projects involving sophomores and freshman students. Most of the projects are related to robotics and AI.

You can learn about my research here and also some posts about general stuff that I like to do.

Thanks for visiting.
