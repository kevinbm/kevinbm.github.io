Welcome to my personal page.

I recently finished a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Engineering">Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria</a> in Lima, Peru.

I am the president of the Artificial Intelligence and Control Systems Research Group (GISCIA) at my university. There, my colleagues and I guide and lead new projects involving students from different Departments, but mostly from the Mechanical Department. The projects are mainly related to robotics and AI.

Lately I've been doing research in ML and NLP advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/amcoronado"> Alberto Coronado </a>. I also have a blog section where I write about some topics in those fields and about general stuff that I find interesting as well.

<br>Thanks for visiting.
