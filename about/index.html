		<p style="margin-top:10px;">Welcome to my personal page.</p>

		<p>I am a prospective student looking to do a PhD in Machine Learning. I got a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Engineering">Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria</a> (UNI) in 2015.

		I am the current president of the Artificial Intelligence and Control Systems research laboratory (<a href="http://giscia.github.io/" target="_blank">GISCIA Lab</a>) at UNI. My colleagues and I guide and lead new projects involving students mostly from the School of Mechatronics Engineering. The projects are mainly related to robotics and AI.

		Lately I've been doing research in ML and NLP advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado"> Alberto Coronado </a>. To find more about me take a look to my research and blog pages.
