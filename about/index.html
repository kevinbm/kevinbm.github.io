		<p style="margin-top:10px;">Welcome to my personal page.</p>

		<p>I am a prospective PhD student looking to do research in Machine Learning. I received a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Engineering">Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria</a> (UNI) in 2015.

		I am the current president of the <a href="http://giscia.github.io/" target="_blank">Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence research laboratory</a> (GISCIA) at UNI. The lab is leaded by UNI students who are interested in following a research career. We have published many papers in local and international conferences/journals, being recognized as one of the strongest labs at UNI. In addition, we try to motivate undergraduate students to get involved in research. The main research topics at GISCIA are related to robotics, machine learning for natural language, computer vision and finance but we are always open to do multidisciplinary work. If you want to know more about the lab, the projects and the current positions of the former members, take a look at the lab's <a href="http://giscia.github.io/" target="_blank">webpage</a>. 

		Lately I've been doing research in ML and NLP advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado"> Alberto Coronado </a>. To find more about me, take a look to my research and blog pages.
